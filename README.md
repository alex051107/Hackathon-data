# Hackathon Data Challenge – Exoplanet Analysis

This repository contains the end-to-end assets for a Carolina Data Challenge
project built around NASA's Planetary Systems archive.  It includes the raw
data snapshots used during the hackathon, reproducible Python analysis
pipelines, on-demand figures and tables, and presentation-ready documentation.

- **Track**: Natural Sciences – Zero Gravity theme
- **Primary dataset**: [NASA Exoplanet Archive, Planetary Systems table](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/)
- **Focus areas**: discovery method evolution, observatory resource planning,
  and habitable-zone candidate prioritisation.

## Repository layout

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `analysis/` | Reproducible Python scripts for each analytical module (method trends, habitability scoring, validation, dashboard builds). |
| `data/` | Curated supporting lookup tables referenced by the analyses. |
| `docs/` | Narrative reports, technical notes, and the full project documentation set. |
| `figures/` | Static visual assets generated by the scripts (PNG exports, kept out of git). |
| `results/` | Machine-readable outputs from the pipelines (CSV and Markdown summaries). |
| `webapp/` | Lightweight Plotly dashboard exported as a standalone HTML presentation. |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies required to reproduce the analyses and dashboard. |
| `International Astronaut Database.csv` / `PS_2025.09.20_08.15.55.csv` | Raw data snapshots provided for CDC exploratory work (kept for provenance). |

A complete file-by-file reference lives in [`docs/file_manifest.md`](docs/file_manifest.md).

## Reproducing the workflows

1. Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the analysis scripts as needed:

   ```bash
   python analysis/method_evolution.py
   python analysis/habitable_priority.py
   python analysis/validate_analysis.py
   python analysis/build_dashboard.py
   ```

   Each script refreshes its corresponding artefacts locally under `figures/`,
   `results/`, and `webapp/`.

3. Consult `results/validation_report.md` to confirm the pipeline health and
   `webapp/index.html` for the interactive visual story.
